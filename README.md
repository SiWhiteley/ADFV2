## Session Name: 
### Cloud Orchestration: PaaS SSIS & Advanced Patterns with Azure Data Factory V2

## Abstract:
Many existing Data Factory solutions include a large number of workarounds due to limitations with the service. Now that Data Factory V2 is available, we can restructure our Data Factories to be lean, efficient data pipelines, and this session will show you how.

The initial Data Factory release was targeted at managing hadoop clusters, with a couple of additional integrations thrown in - it was mistakenly believed to be "the new SSIS" and subsequently there were a lot of very disappointed people. The new release remedies many of these complaints, adding in workflow management, expressions, ad-hoc triggers and many more features that open up a world of possibilities.

This session will run through the new features in ADFV2 and discuss how they can be used to streamline your factories, putting them in the context of real-world solutions. We will also look at the additional compute options provided by the new SSIS integration, how it works within the context of Data Factory and the flexibility it provides.
